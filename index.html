      <div class="pages" id="aboutme">My names matthew Dellitalia.
         i graduated highschool in 2014 and initially went to get my degree in computer science at New York Institute of technology.
         unfortunatelty, after the first semester i decided to take a break from school to help my father with him plumbing company.
         for the past four years i've been working with my father as a plumbing mechanic, and now that the company is doing much
         better i felt it was the ideal time to go back to pursuing my dream of becoming a succesful programmer.
         im not too sure exactly which direction to go in past that but im sure the general assembly school will
         help me to find my way by the end of this course.
